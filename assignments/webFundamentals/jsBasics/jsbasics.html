					<h2>Javascript Basics</h2>
					<p>
						Javascript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language.
						Javascript is extremely popular for a variety of reasons. It is
						small and lightweight language allowing maximum flexibility for
						developers to it in a bunch of different directions. Javascript
						lives inside a host environment (a web browser or Node server), it
						can be connected to the objects of these environments to provide
						programmatic control over them.
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<a href="#">Variable Declaration</a>
							<p>
								Javascript variables are containers for storing data values -
								imagine a cup you fill with coffee, the cup holds the coffee, a
								variable holds a value. All JavaScript variables must be
								identified with unique names. these unique names are called
								identifiers. var x;
							</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<a href="#">Variable Assignment</a>
							<p>
								Assignment operators assign values to JavaScript variables - our
								cup can now have coffee poured in it, giving our variable a
								value to hold. The = assignment operator assigns a value to a
								variable. var x =10;
							</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<a href="#">Data Types</a>
							<p>
								Data Types are an important concept; to be able to operate on
								variables you need to know the data type. There are six data
								types that are JavaScript primitives: Boolean- true or false;
								null - null aka nothing; Number - 42 or 3.14159; String "Coding
								Dojo Rocks!";
							</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<a href="#">Conditionals</a>
							<p>
								When you write code, you want to perform different actions for
								different decisions - hitting different code blocks based on
								values or conditions that have been met. You can use conditional
								statements in your code to accomplish this. There are the
								following conditional statements; if is a specified condition is
								true, do this code in our block; else if to specify a new
								condition to test, if the first condition is false; else we
								execute this block of code;
							</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<a href="#">Loops</a>
							<p>
								There are many different kinds of loop in every programming
								language, but they all essentially do the same thing: they will
								repeat a action some number of times. Imagine you have to run a
								mile, well you run around the track four times and then you
								stop. That a loop!
							</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<a href="#">Function</a>
							<p>
								Functions are an encapsulation of a code block. When we call our
								function this will run that code block. Think of it as a list of
								instructions. As an example imagine we are putting together a
								desk from Ikea, we open up the instruction manual and get
								started, first we screw the legs to the table top; next we place
								the table the right way up. Done! We finished our instructions.
								Sadly there are ton more tables to do so lets call our function
								over and over and over again.
